   The only way to start writing is to start writing. 
   
   It is not the fear of writing that is the blocker, it is the fear of not writing well. The self imperative to write the perfect blog, or the fear that the write-up would be terrible and not worth publishing is predominantly the reason(at least that's what I figured for myself)

   Do remember, as engineers everyone does write really a lot of context - summaries in commits and reviews, emails and chats, Readme's, incident reviews, goals, performance, objectives. And all of them valuable to different audiences.

   And whenever you do write, you would find that most of the thinking, learning and the coherence all happens during the writing than before. Also, it is never the grammar or the spelling or the language, the tough part is creating cohesion from the massive knowledge base in your brain.

   In summary, Everyone can write, and it is just some are better than others more owing to the hours put in writing. And especially with technical blogs, writing for the first time still means it will be useful to an audience, as it is either solutions, tutorials, how to's etc.

   Some tips:

   - Build yourself knowledge graph on the subject you write about, for research, ideas, related
     - tools: Notion, Obsidian, Roam
   - Start by building out a digital garden, where you start by writing (just like a gardener, planting a seed) with the aim for cohesion of thought.
   - Reading your own writing and edit. (This is one of the hardest things for techie's, it's like looking at your code repeatedly even if it works :))
   - Publish once you are happy about the message to the audience, rather than the complexities of language.
   - Delegate the intricacies of the language part to software (e.g.: punctuations, spells)   
     - tools: grammarly.com (also has a vscode plugin), sentencecheckup, etc.
